# RoR2-TTGL-Mod
## TTGL Mod for Risk of rain 2
- TTGL themed mod that currently adds Lagann as a playable survivor in Risk of rain 2
- Made this public so people can have more examples for making mods for the game. For Lagann I used https://github.com/ArcPh1r3/HenryMod as a base since I liked how everything was pretty modular.
- Currently wip, working on the moveset.
